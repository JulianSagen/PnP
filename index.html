		<div id="problem">
			<h1>Too few toilets are a social problem</h1>
			<p>Today, about 40.000 people in Norway are suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases, which affects their digestive system. People that are afflicted by these diseases, often need to visit the toilet up to 40 times a day, according to Arne Schatten.
				It can be stressful to go out in public when you’re not sure if there will be easy access to a toilet. Especially when you have problems with your bladder or digestive system.
				<br>To read about these diseases in Norwegian, go to <a href="http://www.helseinfonett.no/crohns-sykdom/">http://www.helseinfonett.no/.</a>
			</p>
			<p>There are many other reasons why people need to use the restroom. You can be in the need to freshen up before a big event or change your baby’s diaper. You may even have a bladder condition as mentioned above or just use the toilet in a regular fashion.
				Regardless of what you need the restroom for, our main concern is that there are not enough restrooms available to the public.</p>
			<p>Norway is not a big country, and Oslo with a populace of only 650.000 people is not the biggest city in the world. Yet we have found that there is a lack of toilets in Oslo compared to the amount of people inhabiting the area. The toilets which are
				available to the public are usually located at shopping malls, metro stations or restaurants. The ones at shopping malls and metro stations often have a purchase-to-use policy, which often make them inaccessible for people who don’t have money at
				hand.</p>
			<p>Problems can arise when non-paying customers need to use the restaurants toilets and create big lines when there is a rush. It can also be a problem if there are no toilets around, and you end up peeing in public. These are examples of bad behavior,
				which are caused due to lack of toilets. The few public toilets which are available aren’t very easy to locate. This is usually due to poorly signage. </p>

		<div id="solution">
			<h1>Our Solution</h1>
			<p>
				Today most people are carrying a smartphone everywhere they go. We have applications for communication, entertainment and daily life activities. Therefor we thought an application was a sufficient solution, which would also be accessible to the majority
			</p>
			<p>
				That is why we are presenting Loo. An application that lets you locate and rent your nearest toilet using internet and GPS navigation. Loo also lets you rent out your private restroom to customers in your area through the application. This way we believe that we aren’t just making toilets more visible, but also making more toilets available to the public. If you do decide to rent out your own restroom, you can even earn some extra money which we consider a great motivator for people opening up to this solution.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our solution for the application consists of two main factors. A map where the user can search for restrooms in the area of their location, and an owner’s menu where you can rent out their private toilet to by passers. You can read more about this in the application description.
			</p>

			<h2>Short description of the Loo application</h2>
			<p>The users can search and filter the nearby restroom offers on several criteria such as price, location range, size (if it’s a full bathroom or just toilet) and if it is handicap or changing table based restroom. The user can also see images through ratings and comments of the restroom before venturing to be sure that it meets the expected requirements. With our rating system both the user and the owner will give each other scores afterwards based on tidiness, trustworthiness. Give each other a short review, which others can use to base their decisions on. The user preorders the toilet and enters an estimated time of arrival which the maps set for you depending on your location. The owner will get a notification of your order.
				<br>To read more about the application, go to <a href=”#app”>The Loo application</a>
			</p>
			<h2>Future prospects</h2>
			<p>
				Further we hope to expand our network and collaborate with fast-food restaurants such as MacDonald’s, Burger King, Max and others. They usually have a problem with nonpaying customers dropping in to use their toilet. Of course we understand that they want to make a little profit, but sometimes people don’t need the burger or milkshake. Our solution to this problem would be a QR code or an NFC key from our app working on the door lock to the restroom. If the QR code or NFC key are not the solutions, the code for the day could be shown after a purchase, so that the customer would have access all day.
