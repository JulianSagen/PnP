	<!--Information-->
	<main>

		<div id="problem">
			<h1>A Social Problem</h1>
			<p>
				Let us tell you about how the lack of public toilets is a social problem that brings no good to the society. With almost no focus on providing the public with enough public toilets we know how much they mean to social participation.
			</p>

			<p>
				A lack of public toilets can result in social isolation for some, while creating unaffordable barriers for others. If a member of the society has issues with self-control, because of a disability, this could also be a large obstacle in their social engagement. A large number of the world’s population is currently struggling with bowel and/or bladder control, causing them to stay at home because of their belief that there is a lack of toilets they can use.
			</p>

			<p>
				Bathrooms are needed, regardless of what your intended use is, because of this we have made it our goal to provide the public with more bathrooms. Which is why we are introducing Loo. An application that locates your nearest toilet.
			</p>


		</div>

		<div id="solution">
			<h1>The solution</h1>
			<p>
				Loo is our suggested solution to this problem. With the application you may locate the nearest toilet using internet and GPS navigation. Loo also lets you rent out your private restroom to customers in your area through the application. This way we believe
				that we aren’t just making toilets more visible, but also making more toilets available to the public. If you do decide to rent out your own restroom, you can even earn some extra money which we consider a great motivator for people opening up to
				this solution.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our application is mainly divided into two sections. A map, where you, as a costumer can search for restrooms in the area of your location, and an owner’s menu where you as a owner can rent out your private facilities to bypassers. You can read more about this
				in the application description.
			</p>

			<p>
				Furthermore, you as a costumer have the ability to filter your search-criteras, where your options are <strong>price, location range or simply the size of the bathroom</strong>.

			<p>
				Placing an order is simple, the user places an order, which sends the owner a notification. With our intergrated rating system both the user and the owner will be able to give each other reviews afterwards based on tidiness and hospitality.
			</p>
			<h2>Future prospects</h2>
			<p>
				For the future, we wish to cooperate with restaurants to request the lock-combination for their bathroom doors, if a reciept is registered.

					<img src="images/screenshots/kart1.png" alt="map screenshot with handicap location" id="map1" />
					<div>

						<p>
							Locating your nearest toilet is simple. Just open the application, and we will locate those close to you. Although we have added our own functions to simplify the application, we use Google Maps with simple universal icons to show the available facilities at your selected
							location.
						 </p>

						 <p>
							 You can select what facilities you wish to use, for example, a toilet that is easily accessible or has a changing table. The map will then show the restrooms that offers this.
						 </p>

						<p>
							After you find your prefered restroom, a window will pop up. It will display the address of the restroom, what facilities are available, information with photos and user reviews. On this screen you will also find the option to rent the bathroom if wanted.
						</p>

				<h3>Rating System</h3>
				<div class="infoWithImage">
					<img src="images/screenshots/rating1.png" alt="rating screenshots with stars" id="rating" />
					<div>
						<p>
							We have set up a rating system to make it easier for you to share your toilet experience. With a ratingsystem ranging from 1 to 5 stars you can easily read other reviews, or write your own.
						</p>
						<p>
							 Each rating will be posted after a review by the owner. However, the owner may not edit or delete any reviews, as they all will be posted.
						 </p>
						 <p>
							  If the owner does not agree to a posted review, they must contact our Human Resources department where the complaint will be further evaluated.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

			<div>
				<h3>Payment methods</h3>
				<div class="infoWithImage">
