					<h3>Social Problem</h3>

					<p>
					Here at Loo we believe toilets should be accessible anywhere. We have found that there is a lack of toilets in Oslo. You can usually find them at either shopping malls or restaurants, and they often have a purchase-to-use policy. However, the few public toilets that are available aren’t very easy to locate. Because of this, there can often be long lines.
					</p>
					<p>
					Today, about 40.000 people in Norway are suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases, which affects their digestive system. People that are afflicted by these diseases, often need to visit the toilet up to 40 times a day, according to <a href="http://www.helseinfonett.no/crohns-sykdom/ ">Helseinfonet.no</a>. It can be stressful to go out in public when you’re not sure if there will be easy access to a toilet. Especially when you have problems with your bladder or digestive system.
					</p>
					<p>
					However, a bathroom isn’t just for doing your business. You can be in the need to freshen up before a big event or maybe just change your child’s diaper. Regardless, the main concern is that there aren’t enough available toilets to the public.
					</p>

					<h3>Our Solution</h3>
						<p>
							Most people are now carrying a smartphone everywhere they go. They have apps for communication, for fun and for helping them in the daily life. An app is therefore an efficient solution that would be accessible to the majority.
							</p>
							<p>
							That is why we are presenting Loo. An application that lets you locate your nearest toilet using both internet and GPS. Loo lets you rent your private bathroom to private customers. This way we believe we will be making more toilets available to the public. They will also be much easier to find, just open the app!
							</p>
							<p>
							If you decide to rent out your own bathroom, you can even earn some extra money.
						</p>
				</div>

				<div id="theApp" class="infobox" >
					<h3>The App</h3>
					<p> The application contains the following: </p>
					<ul>
					<li>A login profile (for both the user and the owner)</li>
					<li>A map with a navigation system</li>
					<li>Payment methods. (Vipps, PayPal, card and cash)</li>
					<li>Information about individual toilets</li>
					<li>Active/inactive status</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h4>User</h4>

				<br>

					<h5>Registration</h5>
					<p>
					For people who need to use the toilet we offer a simple login system by using Facebook, Google, Microsoft or the user can create an entirely new account using our own account forms.
					<p/>
<br>
					<h5>Maps</h5>
					<p>
					Locating your nearest toilet is simple. Just open the app, and we will locate the ones closest to you. Though we have added our own functions to serve our cause better, we use simple universal icons to show the available facilities at your selected location. Also, you can select what you need at the bathroom. For example, a toilet for disabled or a changing table. The map will then only show the bathrooms that offers this.
					<p/>
<br>
					<h5>Map function</h5>
					<p>
					A window will pop up when you click on the toilet you want on the map. It will display the address of the toilet’s location, what type of toilet it is, other users’ ratings, photos of the toilet and its condition. If the toilet is owned by a private owner, the order button will show and you can select on it. By doing so the owner of the toilet will know that you are on your way.
					<p/>
<br>
					<h5>Payment methods</h5>
					<p>
					Payment depends on the owner of the private toilet. At the moment, we offer the use of Vipps, PayPal, card and cash. You can register your credit card, use PayPal to send money to the owner or you can send money with Vipps directly in our application.
					<p/>
<br>
					<h5>Rating system</h5>
					<p>
					We have set up a rating system so that you can share your toilet experience. Set stars from 1-5 and comment. This will help other people when they are in the need of a bathroom.
					<p/>

<br>
					<h4>Owner - If you wish to rent out your facilities</h4>

<br>
					<h5>Registration</h5>
					<p>
					For people who wishes to rent out their toilets and make a little extra money, you can use the same login profile you made when you needed to locate a toilet. If you haven’t already, follow the instructions by either using our account forms or login with Facebook, Google or Microsoft.
					<p/>
<br>
					<h5>Register toilet</h5>
					<p>
					To register a toilet, select owner followed by add toilet. Enter the information needed to proceed, like your full name, address, functions of toilet, bank account number etc. If you wish to conceal your bank account information, we offer the use of PayPal. Also enter if you are a business or a private home.
					<p/>
<br>
					<h5>Active/inactive function</h5>
					<p>
					If you are not at home or not available for renting out your toilet, you can set your toilets status to be “inactive”. By doing so, the marker on the map disappears. An “inactive” toilet is not visible on the map nor is it possible to rent. This way no one can locate or rent. To make the toilet visible again, set your status to be “active”. Now your toilets location is back on the map and available to rent again.
